# 5-Year-Equity-Performance-and-Risk-Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis of over 500 S&P 500 stocks from 2013 to 2018. It uses a robust Python-to-SQL data pipeline to clean historical price data and calculate key performance metrics (Cumulative Return, Volatility, etc.). The final, analyzed data is loaded into a MySQL database to power a detailed Power BI Dashboard focused on risk-adjusted returns and outlier detection.
